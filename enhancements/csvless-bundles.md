# CSVless Bundles 

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [x] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Test plan is defined
- [ ] Graduation criteria for dev preview, tech preview, GA
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created in [openshift/docs]

## Summary

Describes the specification of a new bundle mediatype that alleviates the need for end users to write and maintain `ClusterServiceVersions` (CSVs).

## Motivation

Operator authors find CSVs difficult to write and maintain. Expressing an OLM-managed operator as a set of related kubernetes objects is more intuitive to users. Supporting plain kubernetes manifests makes OLM more approachable to the wider community, which is relevant in light of the Operator Framework attempting to become a CNCF project.

### Goals

- Simplify the UX of creating and maintaining bundles
- Define a `registry+v1` equivalent bundle spec that doesn't require a CSV
- Describe `opm` commands for building and installing `registry+v2` bundles
- Support adding `registry+v2` bundles to an [Operator Index](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/olm/operator-registry.md#summary)
- Support packageserver surfacing data on plain manifest bundles

### Non-Goals

- Consuming Helm charts
- Enable installing arbitrary kubernetes resources
- Design [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io) support for `registry+v2` bundles

## Proposal

Add support for a new mediatype, `registry+v2`, to the [Operator Bundle spec](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/olm/operator-bundle.md), [operator-registry](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/pkg/api/apis/operators/v1alpha1/clusterserviceversion_types.go), and [OLM](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager) that enables packaging an operator without defining a [ClusterServiceVersion](https://github.com/operator-framework/olm-book).

### User Stories

#### File Format

As an Operator Author, I want a way to store my `registry+v2` bundle as set of files and directories, so that I can:

- iterate on its content locally
- use standard source control tooling to:
  - persist and version it
  - drive pipelines

##### UX

A `registry+v2` bundle will be represented on-disk as a directory tree consisting of a root and two siblings:

- the root is any arbitrary directory in the filesystem that contains the siblings at depth 1
- the `manifests` directory, contains the resource manifests used to generate the final operator manifests at runtime
  - a flat directory
  - may only contain kubectl-able YAML streams
- the `metadata` directory, which contains all metadata
  - doesn't need to be flat
  - contains metadata required for OLM to manage the operator in a `bundle.yaml` file
  - contains an `annotations.yaml` file which contains labels to be projected onto the operator's [Image Format](#image-format).
  - may contain additional arbitrary metadata

_Ex: Kiali Operator_

```sh
$ tree kiali
kiali
├── manifests
│   ├── crds.yaml
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   └── rbac.yaml
└── metadata
    ├── annotations.yaml
    └── bundle.yaml

2 directories, 5 files
```

In order to support all of the features of a `registry+v1` bundle without a CSV, OLM must be given and/or infer the information that would have been provided by the CSV via other resources. Here are the basic requirements and inferences for `registry+v2` bundles.

The `manifests` directory must have at least one `Deployment` resource (to take the place of a CSV's embedded `DeploymentSpec`).

_Ex. kiali/deployment.yaml_

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kiali-operator
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kiali-operator
  template:
    metadata:
      name: kiali-operator
      labels:
        app: kiali-operator
        version: v1.9.1
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: kiali-operator
      containers:
      - name: ansible
        command:
        - /usr/local/bin/ao-logs
        - /tmp/ansible-operator/runner
        - stdout
        image: quay.io/kiali/kiali-operator:v1.9.1
        imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /tmp/ansible-operator/runner
          name: runner
          readOnly: true
      - name: operator
        image: quay.io/kiali/kiali-operator:v1.9.1
        imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /tmp/ansible-operator/runner
          name: runner
        env:
        - name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.annotations['olm.targetNamespaces']
        - name: POD_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.name
        - name: POD_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        - name: OPERATOR_NAME
          value: "kiali-operator"
      volumes:
      - name: runner
        emptyDir: {}

```

Any `CustomResourceDefinitions` found in the streams are included in the bundle as provided APIs (a.k.a. "owned CRDs").

_Ex: kiali/crds.yaml_

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: kialis.kiali.io
  labels:
    app: kiali-operator
spec:
  group: kiali.io
  names:
    kind: Kiali
    listKind: KialiList
    plural: kialis
    singular: kiali
  scope: Namespaced
  subresources:
    status: {}
  version: v1alpha1
  versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: true
    storage: true
---
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: monitoringdashboards.monitoring.kiali.io
  labels:
    app: kiali
spec:
  group: monitoring.kiali.io
  names:
    kind: MonitoringDashboard
    listKind: MonitoringDashboardList
    plural: monitoringdashboards
    singular: monitoringdashboard
  scope: Namespaced
  version: v1alpha1

```

The `bundle.yaml` file consolidates all of the additional info needed by OLM to manage the life cycle of the operator. The set of additional info is exactly (w/ required info in **bold**):

- **name**
- **version**
- **minimum kubernetes version**
- description
- display name
- keywords
- labels
- links
- maintainers
- maturity
- provider
- selector
- icon
- API descriptions

The naming of `bundle.yaml` is strict and is used to identify the file. 

_Ex. olm.yaml_

```yaml
operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.mediatype: registry+v2
name: kiali-operator.v1.9.1
version: 1.9.1
minKubeVersion: 1.17.3

_**Note:** `capabilities` is the equivalent of the `x-discriptors` field found in CSVs._

The `annotations.yaml` file contains the set of labels to be projected onto the container image representation of the bundle. More importantly, it contains the top-level discriminator field used to identify the mediatype of the bundle on-disk: `operators.operatorframework.io.bundle.mediatype: registry+v2`.

#### Build a Bundle Image Without a CSV

As an Operator Author, I want to build an Operator Bundle image from the same set of Kubernetes manifests I would use to deploy an operator manually, without OLM, so that I can avoid writing a CSV.

##### UX

Add a new command to `opm` to initialize a bundle directory, which has:

- a positional parameter -- `src` -- representing the directory containing source manifests
- an option for specifying the output directory -- `-o, --out` -- which defaults to the current directory
- an option for specifying the target mediatype -- `-m, --mediatype` -- and attempts to infer it from the manifests in `src` if not specified
- an option enabling `Dockerfile` generation -- `-d, --generate-dockerfile` -- which defaults to disabled

When no source manifests are present in `src`, default resources are generated. Additionally, when an existing bundle is found in the output directory, an attempt is made to update the current bundle with new information derived from `src` and the existing `metadata` directory (this includes the labels on the generated `Dockerfile` as well).

_Ex. Initialize defaults for `registry+v1` in the current empty directory_

```sh
$ tree .
.

0 directories, 0 files
$ opm bundle init --mediatype 'registry+v1' .
# <logs>
$ tree .
.
├── manifests
│   └── csv.yaml
└── metadata
    ├── annotations.yaml
    └── dependencies.yaml

2 directories, 4 files
```

_Ex. Initialize defaults for `registry+v2` in the current empty directory and generate a dockerfile_

```sh
$ tree .
.

0 directories, 0 files
$ opm bundle init --mediatype 'registry+v2' -d .
# <logs>
$ tree .
.
├── Dockerfile
├── manifests
│   └── deployment.yaml
└── metadata
    ├── bundle.yaml
    ├── annotations.yaml
    └── dependencies.yaml

2 directories, 5 files
```

_Ex. Fail to detect mediatype on empty directory_

```sh
$ tree .
.

0 directories, 0 files
$ opm bundle init .
# <log: "unable to infer mediatype when no manifests are present">
```

_Ex. Infer mediatype from src manifests_

```sh
$ tree kiali-csvless
kiali-csvless
├── crds.yaml
├── deployment.yaml
└── rbac.yaml
$ opm bundle init -o kiali kiali-csvless
# <logs>
$ tree kiali
kiali
├── manifests
│   ├── crds.yaml
│   ├── deployments.yaml
│   └── rbac.yaml
└── metadata
    ├── bundle.yaml
    ├── annotations.yaml
    └── dependencies.yaml

2 directories, 6 files
```

Add a new command to `opm`, `opm bundle build`, which takes as input a directory tree -- described in [File Format](#file-format) -- and outputs an Operator Bundle image.

_Ex._

```sh
$ opm bundle build . # detect the mediatype of the current directory, build it, and if successful, write the image tar.gz to stdout
$ opm bundle build -o image://quay.io/my/bundle:v1.0.0 . # detect the mediatype of the current directory, build it, and if successful, push the image to a remote reference
```
#### Additively Build an Index

As a Pipeline Maintainer, I want to additively build an index of `registry+v2` bundles so that I can release new bundles to an existing index.

##### UX

Extend the `opm index add` command to accept `registry+v2` bundles.

#### Direct Application

As an Operator Author, I want a way to directly apply a `registry+v2` bundle to a cluster -- without a `Subscription` -- so that I can:

- validate the bundle's content
- rapidly prototype my operator

##### UX

Add a new command to `opm`, `opm bundle crds`, which takes as input an Operator Bundle and outputs the set of kubectl-able CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) it provides.

```sh
$ opm bundle crds . # detect the mediatype of the current directory and write a YAML stream containing the provided CRDs to stdout
$ opm bundle crds -o crds.yaml image://quay.io/my/bundle:v1.0.0 # pull and unpack the bundle image, then write the YAML stream to a file
```

Add a new command to `opm`, `opm bundle resources`, which takes as input an Operator Bundle and outputs a set of kubectl-able manifests that represent what OLM would apply to the cluster -- sans provided CRDs and dependencies-- for that bundle.

_Ex._

```sh
$ opm bundle resources . # detect the mediatype of the current directory, generate the resources to apply for it as OLM would, and write the YAML stream to stdout
$ opm bundle resources -o my-bundle.yaml image://quay.io/my/bundle:v1.0.0 # pull and unpack the bundle image, generate the resources to apply for it as OLM would, and write the YAML stream to a file
```

#### Validate Bundles

As a Pipeline Maintainer, I want a way to validate `registry+v2` bundles, so that I can ensure OLM is able to unpack and apply it before I add it to any release index.

##### UX

Add a new command to `opm`, `opm bundle validate`, which takes as input an Operator Bundle and fails with informative errors should the bundle be invalid.

```sh
$ opm bundle validate . # validate the bundle in the current directory, printing the results to stdout
$ opm bundle validate image://quay.io/my/bundle:v1.0.0 -o results.xml # pull, unpack, and validate the remote bundle image, printing the results to a file
```

Results are in [XUnit format](todo).

### Risks and Mitigations

One risk is around backporting indexes with mixed mediatypes to older clusters. This needs to be supported to ensure upgrades and downgrades of OpenShift behave as intended. This is outlined further in the Upgrade/Downgrade section below.

Another risk is around operatorhub.io - it will need to be adjusted to support the `registry+v2` bundles. This work is not scoped as part of this enhancement and is done by a seperate team - how much effort is involved there is unclear.

Security impacts are minimal because the number of kubernetes objects that OLM supports is still the same - just the delivery mechanism (the bundle format) is changing.

## Design Details

### Implementation Details


#### Registry Database Schema Changes

In order to support adding `registry+v2` bundles to a registry database, the `operatorbundle` table schema must be updated to enable more than one mediatype. The table will be extended with a new `mediatype` column with a value that can be one of `{registry+v1, registry+v2}`. A respective migration will also be added to [operator-registy](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/tree/master/pkg/sqlite/migrations) to cover this schema change.

#### Registry API Changes

A new endpoint will be added to service requests for all clients that understand how to unpack `registry+v2` bundles. The previous endpoint will remain active, but will return errors for queries that result in `registry+v1` bundles. This will allow old clients to continue operating while preventing them from resolving bundles they cannot unpack. The errors -- which are typically bubbled to top-level resources -- will help to make unsupported bundle type errors more obvious to end users expecting an update to content managed by an older version of OLM.

#### Index Add Changes

When a `registry+v2` bundle is added to an index, `opm` will synthesize and add a CSV to the respective entry in the `operatorbundle` table. A lot of the existing `opm` and `operator-registry` code assumes bundles always contain CSVs, which make synthesis the simplest path to supporting `registry+v2` bundles.

#### Installtime Bundle Unpacking

At install, a CSV must be generated for a `registry+v2` bundle so that OLM can manage the operator it represents on the cluster. It must also take care not to apply any bundle resources that are usually generated by a CSV (e.g. APIService and Service). This means that when OLM resolves and unpacks a bundle, it needs to recognize its mediatype and take appropriate action.

#### Bundle Validation

The [operator-framework API module](https://github.com/operator-framework/api) will be extended with validators to support `registry+v2` [file format](#file-format) validation in advance of the implementation of the `opm bundle validate` command.


#### Legacy Support for AppRegistry

A bundle of type `registry+v2` can be stored in an AppRegistry type catalog after synthesizing a CSV and removing resources that are usually generated by CSVs. This allows clusters with AppRegistry type catalogs to receive updates to operators whose authors have switched to publishing `registry+v2` bundles.

### Test Plan

There will be e2e tests alongside unit tests. The e2e test will verify that the functionality is delivered as expected - bundles consisting just of kubernetes manifests are installed and managed on cluster by OLM. Potentially existing tests can be reused but with the newer bundle format.

Outside of core OLM there will also be tests in operator-registry to ensure the new bundle format is consistently generated as we expect. Its also critical to test how indexes composed of registry+v2 bundles will behave.

### Drawbacks

- `registry+v2` bundles depart from the established CSV interface OLM has always required and users are familiar with
- In `registry+v1` bundles, all installation details are denormalized in the CSV -- install strategy, provided APIs, etc. -- allowing Operator Authors to publish less manifests and describe their operator as a transaction
